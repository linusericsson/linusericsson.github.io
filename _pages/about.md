# About

I am a first year student of the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. I'm currently working on meta-learning approaches to improving generalisation in deep RL. This work is supervised by [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/).

Previously, I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Durham University.

# Teaching

During my 4th year at Durham University, I undertook weekly teaching and demonstrating tasks. This included helping out students in their first and second years in practicals and marking minor assignments. The main course I taught was the 1st year computer science course [Introduction to Programming](https://github.com/DurhamIP).
