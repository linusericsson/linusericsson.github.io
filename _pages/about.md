I have recently joined the University of Glasgow as a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My research explores AI/ML methods to learn transferable representations of data, building efficient neural networks, and adapting these models across data shifts, all to help people solve problems reliably across different scenarios. Specific interests include representation learning, multi-modal learning, robustness, and automated machine learning (AutoML).

<strong>Prospective PhD Students:</strong>  
I am currently seeking PhD students! There are several routes for application, including <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">available scholarships</a> within the School of Computing Science and the <a href="https://www.divein.org.uk/">DiveIn CDT</a>. Please take a look at my publications to see if our research interests align, and feel free to get in touch by email if you’d like to work with me.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked with [Elliot J. Crowley](https://elliotjcrowley.github.io/) on AutoML and efficient neural network architectures. I hold a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, where my thesis, *Self-Supervised Learning for Transferable Representations*, was supervised by [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) and supported in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/).

## Other Experience
I have worked as an intern with [Steven McDonagh](https://smcdonagh.github.io/) & [Ales Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/) at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, and with [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) & [Da Li](https://dali-dl.github.io/) at Samsung AI Center. Previously, I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Durham University where I worked with [Magnus Bordewich](https://community.dur.ac.uk/m.j.r.bordewich/) on multi-task and transfer learning in RL. During my undergraduate degree I developed an algorithmic composition system with [Steven Bradley](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/s-p-bradley/). I also worked with Professor [Toby Breckon](http://breckon.eu/toby/) at the university over a summer, developing dense stereo vision and visual odometry for robotics. During this time I had the chance to collaborate with the Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition on a project involving Brain-Computer Interfaces as an application of Deep Learning.
