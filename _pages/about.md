## About

I am a first year student of the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. I'm currently working on meta-learning approaches to improving generalisation in deep RL. This work is supervised by [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/).

The project involves learning loss functions for generalising behaviour across environments and alleviating the need for human-crafted reward functions.

```python
# classic loss
loss = cross_entropy(f(x), y)

# learned loss
loss = DNN(f(x), y)
```

Previously, I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Durham University where I worked with [Magnus Bordewich](https://community.dur.ac.uk/m.j.r.bordewich/) on multi-task and transfer learning in RL. During my undergraduate degree I developed an algorithmic composition system with [Steven Bradley](https://www.dur.ac.uk/computer.science/staff/profile/?id=106). I worked with Professor [Toby Breckon](http://breckon.eu/toby/) at the university over a summer, developing dense stereo vision and visual odometry for robotics. During this time I had the chance to collaborate with the Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition on a project involving Brain-Computer Interfaces as an application of Deep Learning.

## Teaching

During my 4th year at Durham University, I undertook weekly teaching and demonstrating tasks. This included helping out students in their first and second years in practicals and marking minor assignments. The main course I taught was the 1st year computer science course [Introduction to Programming](https://github.com/DurhamIP).
