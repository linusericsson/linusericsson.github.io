## About

I am a PhD student in the [Data Science CDT](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. My research is on unsupervised representation learning by learning from underlying structure in data rather than manual annotation. I am also interested in how traditional supervised learning can benefit from self-supervised methods, as the advantage of learning from labels diminishes. This work is supervised by [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) and funded in part by the [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/). My other research interests include multi-modal learning and responsible applications to climate and healthcare.

## Other Experience
I have worked as an intern with [Steven McDonagh](https://smcdonagh.github.io/) & [Ales Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/) at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, and with [Tim Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/) & [Da Li](https://dali-dl.github.io/) at Samsung AI Center. Previously, I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Durham University where I worked with [Magnus Bordewich](https://community.dur.ac.uk/m.j.r.bordewich/) on multi-task and transfer learning in RL. During my undergraduate degree I developed an algorithmic composition system with [Steven Bradley](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/s-p-bradley/). I also worked with Professor [Toby Breckon](http://breckon.eu/toby/) at the university over a summer, developing dense stereo vision and visual odometry for robotics. During this time I had the chance to collaborate with the Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition on a project involving Brain-Computer Interfaces as an application of Deep Learning.

## Teaching

I have undertaken tutoring, demonstrating and marking roles while studying both in Edinburgh and Durham.  Courses Iâ€™ve taught include [Introduction to Programming](https://github.com/DurhamIP) (in Python/Java), Introductory Applied Machine Learning and Theory of Computation.
